# You are curious

If you are reading this ou have discovered a hamilton-7 from pilot-1. This is a
very early prototype of the hamilton-7 (29 September 2016). This mote samples
temperature once every 10 seconds and immediately sends it out.

## Power Qualification

This mote has been qualified as consuming < 25uA of average current at 3.3V
at 25.0 C. With this, we expect it will continue operating for more than
five years (well past 2021).
